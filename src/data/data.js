		Description:

If any wild animal is detected in the frames, an alert is immediately initiated with frames along with a timestamp. Proposed system was found to be effective with an average precision score of 0.743.',

The frames extracted from the video sequences are checked for the overflowing of garbage from the bins and are classified accordingly with the help of creation of bounding boxes. The proposed system would help in automating the overflowing garbage detection process and by coordinating it with surveillance systems, a state of the art real time monitoring system can be obtained that would ease out the work of municipal departments and concerned authorities.',

Proposed an innovative ensemble model consisting of two YOLOv8 models—one focused on detecting fire and smoke, and the other specifically designed for smoke detection. This dual-model approach aims to enhance the accuracy of real-time fire and smoke detection in CCTV surveillance systems. Advanced image preprocessing methods such as super resolution and the Lucy-Richardson algorithm are employed to enhance input video frames. Proposed models obtained a precision and recall of 0.98 and 0.99 respectively.',
