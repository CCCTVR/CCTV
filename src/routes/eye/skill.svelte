<h2>Skill Development Programmes</h2>
<p>The country is witnessing huge number of video surveillance installations coming up and there is a great need for trained manpower in this field.</p>
<p>CCTV system integrators are not able to train them and put them on the field.</p>
<p>Hence this activity will be taken up by the center by way of conducting skill development programmes providing hands on training inthe domain of CCTV surveillance. Essentially,the programme comprises of two modules which are briefly explained below.</p>

<h2>Module 1</h2>
<p>This module will impart training towards installation, commissioning and maintenance of video surveillance systems.</p>
<p>Topics will be related to cameras (analog & IP),recorders like DVR and NVR, PoE switches, l2 manageable switches, wired and wireless connectivity ,OFC cables and termination etc. The module will have 30% theory and 70% practicals/labs suitable for ITI and Diploma holders. On successful completion of this programme, they will become full fledged CCTV technicians and will be employed by CCTV system integrators. A few sessions will be allocated for communication skills.</p>

<h2>Module 2</h2>
<p>This modules will impart training on Software tools extensively deployed in video surveillance systems and a candidate can choose to become an expert on any of these tools which are explained below in brief.</p>

<h2>Comsur</h2>
<p>This is a tool to carry out auditing of video footages from live camera feeds, Video quality enhancement , automatic video data backup on the cloud (in case of failure of recorders for data recovery) and automatic incident report being generated in MS power point.</p>

<h2>Video Mangagement Software [VMS]</h2>
<p>This software is the operation centre of large video surveillance systems responsible for capturing, monitoring and recording of all the live camera feeds on to a central or distributed network storage devices. It has many other rich features including book marking, event detections, generating alarms and messages etc.</p>
<p>This software has been developed and supplied by M/S VIDEONETICS, India.</p>

<h2>GateBOT</h2>
<p>It is an ANPR(Automatic Number Plate recognition) software solution which is powered, real time edge processing based end to end fully automated system backed by artificial intelligence to efficiently identify, monitor and authorise vehicles entering or exiting gated premises.</p>
<p>It detects entry and exit of vehicles and stores their details including license plate number vehicle type, in/out time etc in the database.</p>
<p>It can be seamlessly integrated with existing/new CCTV cameras, boom barriers, automatic gates, traffic lights, other audio video alert systems, and QR reader to deliver a complete unmanned experience. </p>
<p>It performs real time edge processing without costly servers with optional internet connection. Runs on a standard Windows platform.</p>
