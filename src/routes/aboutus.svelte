    <p class="text-lg font-medium w-[70rem] p-4 ">
        The Center for CCTV Research, located at Bengaluruâ€™s prestigious RV College of Engineering campus has been created with the intention of being the catalyst to bridge the wide gap between the industry and creation & execution of humongous CCTV projects in the country. The Center aims to fulfill the gap of knowledge, practice, protocols, testing, experiments, certification, training, expertise etc. While being a one stop shop for all CCTV project requirements, it would be also the synthesis and the coordination center for all major CCTV players in the country and beyond. The creation and operations of this Center would be a clear manifestation of this dream.
