	<p>
		Research activities will be of paramount importance for the Center which will be carried out
		involving the participation of both Faculty and students of RVCE.
	</p>
	<p>The broad area of the research work will be under INTELLIGENT VIDEO ANALYTICS.</p>
	<p>
		As the country is witnessing CCTV installations in large numbers, it sets constraints to keep
		monitoring all the cameras by human operators as it is a very cumbersome process. Hence, there
		is a need to develop intelligent agents(software) which can automatically detect events and
		raise alerts/messages without much of human intervention. Since, AI, ML and DL have become the
		game changer technologies of the future, they can be very effectively applied on live camera
		feeds to get the desired results. Hence, this opens up a challenging field of research to
		develop intelligent algorithms for video analytics.

	<p>
		Application areas will cover traffic management, public safety, law enforcement, environment,
		video forensics and health care.
